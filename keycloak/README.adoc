To run the sample, ensure you have https://docs.docker.com/install/[docker installed].
If you are using Ubuntu, you can use `./ubuntu-install-docker.sh`.

Once docker is installed, you can run `./keycloak.sh` which will start keycloak container and make keycloak available on port `9999`.

Next start up `flight-tracker` application and then access http://localhost:8080/login.html

You can login with the username `user` and the password `password`.

The sample will then alert the access token.
